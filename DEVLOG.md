**What I did**:
- Added `get_distros` command
- getting the distros successfully
- Lists of distros in frontend

**Problems**:
- output is garbage characters (encoding issue) ✅
- before using `from_utf8_lossy`, switched to `from_utf8` (returns a Ok() of string) ✅

**Next**:
- ~~Making a menu for distros~~
- Launching distros
